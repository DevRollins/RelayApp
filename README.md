# RelayApp
SWE3400 Group Project

This is a project that will be done collaboratively. 
The goal is to create a messaging app similar to Snapchat that utilizes an AI chatbot. The chatbot
will also hide a horror element, in which it will escalate its permissions and ask personal questions
about the user for a thrill. With consent, of course.
